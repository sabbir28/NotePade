Certainly! Here's the Markdown file (vibrate.md) for the `vibrate` class:

# vibrate

The `vibrate` class provides vibration functionality in the Reverse Shell Android application. It allows you to control the device's vibrator and perform vibration patterns.

## Constructor

### `vibrate(Context context)`

- Initializes a new instance of the `vibrate` class.
- Parameters:
  - `context`: The application context.

## Methods

### `vib(int i)`

- Performs vibration with the specified pattern.
- Parameters:
  - `i`: The number of times the vibration pattern should be repeated.

## Usage

To use the `vibrate` class, create an instance of it by passing the application context to the constructor.

Example:
```java
vibrate vibrator = new vibrate(getApplicationContext());
```

To perform vibration with a specific pattern, call the `vib()` method and provide the desired number of repetitions.

Example:
```java
vibrator.vib(3); // Perform vibration pattern 3 times
```

Make sure to include the necessary permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file to use the vibrator:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```

Please note that the actual implementation and behavior of the vibration patterns may vary depending on the device and Android version.
