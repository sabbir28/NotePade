The `videoRecorder` class is a service in the Reverse Shell Android application that handles video recording functionalities. It utilizes the camera and media recorder to capture video from the specified camera ID.

## Methods

- This method is called when the service is started. It receives an `Intent` and performs video recording based on the instructions provided.

### `startVideo(int cameraID, OutputStream outputStream)`

- This method starts the video recording process.
- Parameters:
  - `cameraID`: The ID of the camera to be used for recording.
  - `outputStream`: The output stream to send status updates.

### `videoStop(OutputStream outputStream)`

- This method stops the video recording and performs necessary cleanup.
- Parameters:
  - `outputStream`: The output stream to send status updates.

### `sendData(File file, OutputStream outputStream)`

- This method sends the recorded video data to the specified output stream.
- Parameters:
  - `file`: The video file to be sent.
  - `outputStream`: The output stream to send the video data.

## Permissions

The following permissions are required in the AndroidManifest.xml file to use the video recording functionality:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

## Usage

To use the `videoRecorder` class, you can start the service by passing appropriate instructions and camera ID to the `startService()` method.

Example:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), videoRecorder.class);
intent.putExtra("ins", "startFore");
intent.putExtra("cameraid", "0");
startService(intent);
```

To stop the video recording, use the following code:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), videoRecorder.class);
intent.putExtra("ins", "stopFore");
startService(intent);
```

Make sure to handle the necessary permissions and provide appropriate error handling as needed.

Please note that the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and configurations of your Reverse Shell Android application.
