# newShell

The `newShell` class provides functionality for executing shell commands and interacting with a remote shell through a socket connection. It allows you to execute shell commands, receive command output, transfer files, and handle socket communication.

## Constructor

### `newShell(Activity activity, Context context)`

- Initializes a new instance of the `newShell` class.
- Parameters:
  - `activity`: The activity context.
  - `context`: The application context.

## Methods

### `executeShell(Socket socket, OutputStream outputStream)`

- Executes shell commands and handles socket communication.
- Parameters:
  - `socket`: The socket connection.
  - `outputStream`: The output stream to write command output.
- Throws:
  - `Exception` if an error occurs during shell execution or socket communication.

## Usage

To use the `newShell` class, create an instance of it by passing the activity context and application context to the constructor.

Example:
```java
newShell shell = new newShell(this, getApplicationContext());
```

To execute shell commands and handle socket communication, call the `executeShell()` method and pass the socket connection and output stream.

Example:
```java
try {
    shell.executeShell(socket, outputStream);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
