The `config` class in the Reverse Shell Android application contains configuration settings for the application. Here's an overview of the class:

```java
public class config {
    public static String IP = "192.168.0.105";
    public static String port = "8888";
    public static boolean icon = true;
}
```

The `config` class is a simple Java class with three public static fields:

- `IP`: Represents the IP address used for the reverse shell connection. The default value is set to "192.168.0.105".

- `port`: Represents the port number used for the reverse shell connection. The default value is set to "8888".

- `icon`: Represents a boolean flag indicating whether the application icon should be hidden. The default value is set to `true`.

These configuration settings can be accessed and modified from other parts of the application as needed.
