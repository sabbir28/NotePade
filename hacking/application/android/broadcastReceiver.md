# Reverse Shell Android Application - BroadcastReceiver Class

The `broadcastReceiver` class in the Reverse Shell Android application is a `BroadcastReceiver` that listens for a specific broadcast event and ensures that the main service is running. This Markdown document provides an overview of the class and its functionality.

## Class Overview

The `broadcastReceiver` class extends `BroadcastReceiver` and checks if the main service is already running. If the service is not running, it restarts the service by creating an intent and starting it.

## Class Details

### `onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)`

The `onReceive` method is called when the broadcast event is received. It performs the following actions:

- Logs a message indicating that the broadcast event has been received.
- Calls the `isMyServiceRunning` method to check if the main service is already running.
- If the main service is running, logs a message indicating that there is no need to restart the service.
- If the main service is not running, logs a message indicating that the service needs to be restarted and starts the main service by creating an intent and calling `startService`.

### `isMyServiceRunning(Context context)`

The `isMyServiceRunning` method checks if the main service is currently running. It performs the following actions:

- Retrieves the `ActivityManager` instance from the context.
- Iterates through the running services and checks if the main service is in the list of running services.
- If the main service is found, returns `true`.
- If the main service is not found, returns `false`.

This method is used to determine if the main service is running or not.
